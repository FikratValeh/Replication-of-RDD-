First step  - Find pension data from the IRS 5500 forms. In the IRS website, data is published from 1999. The authors use 1990-1998 data however. 
              For 1990-98 IRS forms the data can be found in this link - https://crr.bc.edu/data/form-5500-annual-reports/. 
            - Datasets are gigantic - initial clean up in Excel is necessary to process the data in Python at a faster pace. Delete unnecessary columns. 
              Columns used in the study are as follows - 'TYPE_PENSION_BENEFIT_IND', 'SPONS_DFE_EIN', 'SPONS_DFE_PN',
              'CUSIP_ISSUER_NUM', 'TOT_ASSETS_BOY_AMT', 'TOT_LIABILITIES_BOY_AMT', 'TOT_ASSETS_EOY_AMT', 'TOT_LIABILITIES_EOY_AMT', 'TOT_CONTRIB_AMT',
              'TOT_DISTRIB_BNFT_AMT'. 
            - Authors do not make this explicit but these columns are used for the creation of the following variables 
                  normal cost  = TOT_DISTRIB_BNFT_AMT
                  total liabilities = TOT_LIABILITIES_BOY_AMT
                  total assets = TOT_ASSETS_BOY_AMT
                  total contributions = TOT_CONTRIB_AMT
            - Each firms may sponsor more than one penison plan. SPONS_DFE_PN shows the unique number of each pension plan give the firm EIN - SPONS_DFE_EIN.

Second step - Download Compustat files. The item list to download is attached in this working directory under compustat_variables.xslx name

Third step = Match Compustat and IRS 5500 files year by year by CUSIP number. Authors indicate that they also used EIN and firm names while matching. But 
             since they do not indicate how, I only use CUSIP for matching. 
             
Fourth step - Create DRC and MFC variables to determine Mandatory Contributions variable. Authors also consider 80 and 90% cut off point while calculating 
              DRC. I skip that step due to the time limitations. I alo crease FS varible - which is the average of funding gap between assest and liabolities
              of each pension plan. If a firm has one pension plan - average is straightforward. If a firm has more than one pension plan, FS is the average
              over those pension plans. 

Fifth step - I merge cross sectional data over years to create the panel. The panel is unbalanced and the sample size is (n * t) = 5424.
             I suppose it is less than the author's sample because I did not match by EIN and Corporate Names. 

Sixth step - report panel data estimates with fixed time and firm effects, and export descriptive statistics for the panel.
