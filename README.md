# Replication-of-RDD-
In this project I replicate  Bakke and Whited 2012 paper in corporate finance. I access the data through WRDS database and Boston College database for IRS 5500 forms between 1990-1998 to replicate the Regression Discontinuity Design. 
WRDS files are not public - hence, I do not put it in this working folder
